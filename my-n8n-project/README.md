# Jarvis-like Automation with n8n

This project aims to create a Jarvis-like assistant using n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool. The workflows and custom nodes defined in this project will allow you to automate various tasks and create a smart assistant experience.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-n8n-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   Compile the TypeScript files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run n8n**
   Start n8n with the following command:
   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

## Usage

- **Workflows**: The `example-workflow.json` file contains a sample workflow that demonstrates how to use the custom nodes and automate tasks. You can import this workflow into your n8n instance.

- **Custom Nodes**: The `custom-node.ts` file defines a custom node that extends the base functionality of n8n. You can modify this node to add your own logic and capabilities.
